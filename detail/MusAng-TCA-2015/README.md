## Abstract
An approximation to the many-body London dispersion energy in molecular and/or solid state systems is expressed as a functional of the occupied orbitals. Starting from the local-RPA theory, where the occupied orbitals are localized molecular orbitals and the virtual space is approximated by projected oscillator orbitals, *i.e.* functions obtained by multiplying the occupied orbitals with spherical harmonic polynomials having their origin at the barycenter of the occupied virtual orbitals a non-empirical correlation energy expression is derived. Detailed expressions are given for the relevant matrix elements.
